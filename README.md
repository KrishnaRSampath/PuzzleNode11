============

This is my solution to Puzzle Node Problem #11 -- "Hitting Rock Bottom"


RELEVANT FILES:  
refactored_midterm.rb -- The most up-to-date (and working!) version of my code.  

k\_midterm.rb -- not as elegant, and after I commented the code, it broke.  
new.rb -- first version of my code that worked and generated the correct output  
(Succeeded on first submission to PuzzleNode, but it is messy coding.)  
complex_output.txt -- What my code generates as output  

  
11-hitting-rock-bottom.md -- The original problem, from PuzzleNode  
simple\_cave.txt -- Testing file.  
simple\_out.txt -- What they expect the output to look like.  
complex\_cave.txt -- the actual input to be used.
