============

This is my solution to Puzzle Node Problem #11 -- "Hitting Rock Bottom"

Relevant Files:
refactored_midterm.rb -- The most up-to-date (and working!) version of my code.

k_midterm.rb -- not as elegant
new.rb -- first version of my code that worked and generated the correct output. (Succeeded on first submission to PuzzleNode, but it is messy coding.)
complex_output.txt -- What my code generates as output.

11-hitting-rock-bottom.md -- The original problem, from PuzzleNode
simple_cave.txt -- Testing file.
simple_out.txt -- What they expect the output to look like.
complex_cave.txt -- the actual input to be used.
