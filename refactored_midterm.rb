# Solution to Puzzle Node Problem 11
# 
# Takes in a file (e.g., "complex_cave.txt") and reads in each line.
# The first line is the amount of water (represented by '~') with which to fill the cave.
# The remainder is a diagram of the cave to be filled with water.
#
# Procedure simple_water_fill takes in a cave (represented as an array of arrays,
# with each row of the cave represented as an internal array, and each column
# represented as cells of the same position within any row).  It then fills the cave with
# as much water as specified earlier, according to the following logic:
# 
# 1) If there is empty space below the current cell, it flows down.
# 2) If there is no space below the current cell, but there is in front, it flows forward.
# 3) If both are blocked, it moves back up and to the left until it finds a row that is 
# empty, and then flows forward.
#
# The optional "print_cave" function prints the cave after it has been filled.
#
# Output: The final function ("output"), simply runs through the cave itself, summing the
# total number of water in each column and prints that to the screen in a line.  If any
# water causes an 'overhang' (where a '~' appears above empty spaces), "output" will print
# a '~' to represent a partial fill.


#Initial Definitions:
#rows = File.readlines("simple_cave.txt") # Uncomment this line to see the simple example.

count = rows[0].to_i    # The first line is how much water to use.
last_row = rows.length-1

cave = []
rows[2..last_row].each do |row|
  cave << row.chomp.split('')

  if cave[row+1][col] == ' ' then   # Flows down if cell below is empty.
